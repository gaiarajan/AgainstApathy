Every two years, 435 congresspeople representing the 50 states travel to Washington DC, composing the House of Representatives. However, the distribution of where these representatives come from is based on the proportions of the American population per state, meaning that in 43 of those states, there are multiple congresspeople. The district each of these congresspeople represent is drawn out every ten years with the release of the new census, with 747,000 people in each district on average. In an ideal world, these districts would be created in a fairly logical way to ensure that all people living in the desired area were represented equally. However, at times, partisan motives overcome creating a fair electoral map. 
The process of  giving one group or party an advantage through redistricting is known as gerrymandering. Gerrymandering has historically operated on both partisan and racial bases. It tends to follow three methods in practice: packing, cracking, and kidnapping. In packing, lines are drawn to pack a demographic into one district, minimizing the impact of their voice. Cracking is when a voting demographic is broken up into several districts, and thus their voting impact is overwhelmed by surrounding opposition votes. Ultimately, gerrymandering has served to hinder American democracy for several centuries, and must be illegalized in favor of a fairer process for redistricting.
